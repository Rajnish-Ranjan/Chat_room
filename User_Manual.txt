//*USER MANUAL*//
Welcome! This guide will walk you through the basics of designing Chat
Room using PHP, where two users can interact.

This project uses two html interfaces/forms.
One is to validate user and the other one is chat room while the user's
session is in.

The history of whole chat is stored in a text file including the date
and time of entering of the massege.
Image or text massege can be entered in the massege box.


*Install XAMPP on your PC.

*Open XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL as well.

*Enter to the directory XAMPP/htdocs in 'C' drive.

//From here, any php file can be viewed using browser.

*Make index.php and supportive files as chat.php under chat directory.

*Open URL: localhost/chat_room/index.php in browser and open it in inginnito mode too.

*Login from different name in both mode.

*If there will be two users already chatting, You will not be allowed to chat

*If the chat is just going to start. You can post a message

*Refresh the chat and if your counter-part has posted the message. Then post the message

*Now you can chat one by one.
