  Folders used
 	1> images/ - Here images are kept after uploading

 	2> toUpload/ - This folder contains images and files that can be uploaded for chat

 3)Code Workflow
 	*On opening the file index.php. It reads the form(inside html) code here if the values of username is posted It transfers it's control to php code written inside it

 	There are two cases

 	1> When It's not login
 	 An interface will be provided to give username.
 		Now after entering the name it will match with the existing users using chat.php . If the existing users wil be less than two, It will allow.
 	2>When it's login the control goes to form with entries (massege,upload image, send or clear(X))
 	When any of these inputs will be affected, the control will transfer to the class chatting of the file chat.php .

  4)FAQ/TROUBLESHOOT -
